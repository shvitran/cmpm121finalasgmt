/* A program by Sherry Tran

In this game, you must get the ball to the center of the maze device by tilting the device itself, which will advance you to the next level.
With each device, the difficulty of the maze gets harder. There are a total of 3 devices.
Use the arrow keys to tilt the device (right will push the board down on the right, left will push the board down on the left,
  up will push the device towards the back, and down will push the device towards the front).
  
Good luck and enjoy!
